# My DSA Journey 🚀

This repo is my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice space.  
I’m starting from scratch and following the **Namaste DSA Sheet** as my structured roadmap to learn, practice, and grow. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## 🎯 My Goals

- Understand core DSA concepts from beginner to advanced.
- Practice real problems from an industry‑tested sheet. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Implement clean solutions and track progress.
- Build confidence for interviews and problem‑solving.

---

## 📘 My Learning Plan

I will follow the **Namaste DSA Sheet** topics in order, including: :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### Foundation

Basic programming logic and entry‑level problems. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Arrays & Strings

Core array and string problems to strengthen logic. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### Linked Lists

Learn list operations and typical problem patterns. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

### Stacks & Queues

Classic data structures with real use cases. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

### Searching & Sorting

Important algorithms like binary search, merge sort, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

### Two Pointers & Sliding Window

Pattern‑based techniques for optimized solutions. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

### Trees & Binary Search Trees

Hierarchical structures and recursive thinking. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

### Heap, Greedy & Backtracking

Advanced topics with practical problems. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

### Dynamic Programming & Graphs

High‑impact topics for interview prep. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

_(I’ll update this section with links to solved problems as I go!)_

## 📌 Resources I’m Using

- **Namaste DSA Sheet** – structured problem list to follow. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
- Official documentation & algorithm visualizers.
- Practice platforms (LeetCode, GfG, etc.).

## 📈 Progress Tracking

I’ll update this section as I make progress. For example:

| Topic        | Status      |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Foundation   | ✓ Started   |
| Arrays       | In Progress |
| Strings      | Not Started |
| (…and so on) |             |
